                      		<p><b>Synopsis:</b>	A year after defeating Richmond Valentine, Gary "Eggsy" Unwin has officially joined Kingsman, having taken his late mentor Harry Hart's title of Galahad as well as Harry's old house, and is dating Tilde, Crown Princess of Sweden, whom he saved from Valentine. On his way home from the tailor shop, he is ambushed by Charlie Hesketh, a rejected Kingsman applicant who lost his right arm and vocal cords during the Valentine incident. Eggsy evades Charlie and his henchmen in a car chase across London, but Charlie's cybernetic arm, severed in the skirmish, hacks into the Kingsman servers through the computer in Eggsy's car. With the information thereby gained, Poppy Adams, the leader of the world's largest drug cartel, the Golden Circle, launches missiles that destroy Kingsman headquarters and kill all the agents in Britain, including Eggsy's best friend Roxy and his other friend Brandon, who was at Eggsy's house to look after his dog while Eggsy was away in Sweden with Tilde</p>
