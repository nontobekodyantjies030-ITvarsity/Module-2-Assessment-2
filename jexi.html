                      		<p><b>Synopsis:</b>	Phil's coworkers Craig (Ron Funches) and Elaine (Charlyne Yi) invite him to play kickball, but the socially inept Phil declines. Immersed in his phone, he walks into Cate (Alexandra Shipp), a local bike shop owner. She attempts to flirt, but Phil is more concerned with his phone until another cyclist bumps into him, breaking his phone. Taking his phone to be replaced, Phil is berated by phone store employee Denice (Wanda Sykes) for being overly reliant on his phone to navigate life. Setting up his new phone, Phil gives “Jexi”, the device's virtual assistant, access to all his accounts after neglecting to read the user agreement. Designed to “make his life better”, Jexi aggressively tries to break Phil out of his bad habits. Posing as Phil, she emails an insulting letter to Kai demanding a promotion. Kai demotes Phil to the “comments section” with the older employees in the basement. When Craig and Elaine invite Phil to kickball again, he claims to be busy but Jexi embarrassingly corrects him. Phil joins them but costs the team the game; he invites everyone out for drinks, but they turn him down. Thinking about Cate, Phil looks up her bike shop, and Jexi calls the store despite his protests, preventing him from hanging up. Phil stumbles through an awkward conversation with Cate, eliciting Jexi's sympathy.</p>
